# Tiger

Tiger (or ReGit spelled backwards) is a simplified Git written in Go.

## Why?

Why not? I mostly want to learn how Version Control Systems work from the inside out.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Git Compatible
- [ ] Offer five commands for starters
    - [ ] Start: start repository
    - [ ] Add: add changes to repository
    - [ ] Remove: Remove changes to repository
    - [ ] Resolve: Resolve conflicts (either interactively or automatically)
    - [ ] Undo: Undo changes to repository
